# duster

'duster' is a `shiny` webapp focused on removing large scale dust from old photographs. If you can't face clicking on each of scores of dust spots in each of many images with some 'heal' tool, or your favourite photo tool leaves 'dusted' images looking widely blurred, then 'duster' might help.
