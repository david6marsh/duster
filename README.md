# duster

‘duster’ is a `shiny` webapp focused on removing large scale dust from
old photographs. If you can’t face clicking on each of scores of dust
spots in each of many images with some ‘heal’ tool, or your favourite
photo tool leaves ‘dusted’ images looking widely blurred, then ‘duster’
might help.
